hello I am <b>ayushsingh</b> and this is <b>2024</b> I'm in my journy to learn <br>
to learn <b>moblie application devlopement </b> and I'm started by learing <b>java</b><br>
In this git repo I made very simple calculator form java which can perform 5 <br>
operations on two operand given to it, by making this program at my very first <br>
stage of programming journy i learned to take inputs, logical operation on inputs<br>
and many fudamental concepts. If you are reading this feel free to review my work <br>
and reach me at ig:<b> quotes_and_code</b>, thanks.
